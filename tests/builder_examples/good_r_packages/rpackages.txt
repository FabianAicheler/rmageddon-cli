Title: Empirical Analysis of Digital Gene Expression Data in R
Description: Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq expression profiles with biological replication. Implements a range of
              statistical methodology based on the negative binomial distributions, including empirical Bayes estimation, exact
              tests, generalized linear models and quasi-likelihood tests. As well as RNA-seq, it be applied to differential
              signal analysis of other types of genomic data that produce counts, including ChIP-seq, Bisulfite-seq, SAGE and
              CAGE.
